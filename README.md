# CO2BLOCK-to-python
A tool for estimation of CO2 storage capacity in saline aquifers based on pressure build-up.
This programme was originally written by Silvia De Simone and Samuel Krevor in MATLAB, this code is a language conversion to Python.

The original MATLAB programme is also a free license software linked here: https://github.com/co2block/CO2BLOCK
